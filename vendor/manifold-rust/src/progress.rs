// progress.rs — optional, throttled progress reporting for the long-running
// boolean pipelines.
//
// This is the sibling of `cancel.rs`: both are threaded through the kernel as
// an `Option<&_>` so that the "nobody is watching" path — every pre-existing
// caller — is byte-for-byte the code that ran before the feature existed.
// `None` touches no atomic and takes no lock; the branch folds out of the
// hot loops entirely because the *decision* is made once per phase, at the
// call site of a map, not per element.
//
// The C++ reference has an equivalent (`ExecutionContext`'s donePhases /
// totalPhases / Progress()), which `cancel.rs` deliberately did not port. This
// module is not a port of it: the C++ counts whole pipeline phases, while the
// robust engine's phases are wildly unequal in cost, so we report a *named*
// phase plus an intra-phase fraction instead. Nothing here can change a
// computed value — the reporter is write-only from the kernel's point of view.
//
// Who reports what:
//   robust/intersection_graph.rs  NarrowPhase, SelfIntersections,
//                                 CandidatePoints, Registries, Arrangements
//   robust/coplanar_clip.rs       CoplanarOverlaps (only when there are
//                                 coplanar overlap regions)
//   robust/cells.rs               Cells (per arrangement edge)
//   robust/mod.rs                 Winding, Assemble (phase transitions only)
//   boolean3.rs                   ExactBoolean (one indeterminate phase; the
//                                 exact engine's internals are not
//                                 instrumented, so its timing stays exactly
//                                 what it was)
//   minkowski.rs                  Minkowski (hulls and batch reductions)
//
// Every determinate phase closes with `complete_phase`, which emits exactly
// 1.0 — the throttle alone leaves up to `total / 100` units unreported.
//
// Threading model: the callback is invoked under a `Mutex`, so it is never
// re-entered concurrently even when the `parallel` feature has rayon workers
// driving `advance`. It *can* be invoked from a worker thread rather than the
// caller's; consumers that need a specific thread must marshal themselves.
// Under contention two workers can cross the throttle together and both
// report, and the one whose increment landed first can reach the lock second;
// `emit` drops a fraction below the last one emitted in the phase, so the
// stream a consumer sees never goes backwards.
